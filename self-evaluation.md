# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

A little shaky but getting used to it.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had a lot of syntax errors. Conceptually it made sense but lack of familiarity made it bumpy.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to practice syntax. I will be practicing by trying to make a little game :).

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'm not even sure what questions I have at the moment. I'm sure more will come up as I go!
